# Rusterix
This project is inspired by the C++ library 
[AsterCXX](https://github.com/dgrafe/astericxx) found on GitHub.
AsterCXX is a library for encoding and decoding aeronautical telemetry data 
according to the [Asterix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASTERIX) standard 
maintained by Eurocontrol.

The idea behind this project is to use a set of user-defined xml files that 
defines the the ASTERIX categories's memory layout to generate a
easy-to-use ASTERIX encodieng/decoding library.

## Features
- Easy-to-use Rust API for encoding and decoding ASTERIX data.
- Configuration-driven design for defining custom data types.

## TODO List
- Implement the full ASTERIX standard.
- Implement encoding functionality.
- Write unit tests for all modules.
- Add comprehensive error handling.
- Improve documentation and examples.
