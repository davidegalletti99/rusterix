# Rusterix
This project is a Rust revisitation of the C++ library 
[AsterCXX](https://github.com/dgrafe/astericxx) found on GitHub.
AsterCXX is a library for encoding and decoding aeronautical
telemetry data according to the [Asterix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASTERIX)
standard maintained by Eurocontrol.

This library, like the astericxx library, is intended to be an implementation of 
the ASTERTIX data types.
